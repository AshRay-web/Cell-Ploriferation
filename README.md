# Cell-Ploriferation
Using Python, I am simulating here cell proliferation. One program just focuses on proliferation and migration while the other accounts for the differentiation.

Here, we see the use of the random walk theory treating proliferation as a stochastic process.

There is also some sensitive analysis done, but others are open to interpret. It is a random process, to find a pattern is very difficult. But some conclusions can be made, such as there is not much of dependence on the initial no of the cell for the saturation of total cells.
